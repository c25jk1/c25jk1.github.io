		<p> About Me: <br/> I was born in Santa Monica, CA, but I moved to New York City when I was young. Despite the fact that I have lived most of my life on the east coast, there are many parts of my identity that I associated with the west coast. I'm very thankful that I got the oppertunity of live in both Los Angeles and New York because it give me more perspective on the way cities and communities run when I travel.
		<br/> 
		<br/>
		I play ice hockey and watch and exessive amout of NHL games. I'm the starting right defense on the New York City Cyclones girls team, and also the pround captain. I'm also very lucky that I know people in sports, so if I don't have too much work, I'll probably be wondering around MSG or Chelsea Piers looking to watch hockey. I love watching NHL games, college hockey practices, kids my age falling on their asses, and even those late night beer leauge games. The fastest way to get on my good side or impress me is to take me skating and match my speed if you can't outskate me.
