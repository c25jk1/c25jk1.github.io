		<p> October 6, 2022 - Today I spend a lot of class changing the colors of my website. I had most of the logistics layed out so I really got to focus on aesthetics. There are a lot of tags and style choices that I wouldn't even think to add, so I found it enjoyable to experiment and find the styles that worked with my aesthetic. I definatly prefer muted colors to the brighter options that are named with more common names. Becasue of this, searching for the right colors was kind of a pain, but once I had everything saved, I really liked the way that my website turned out. :) </p>

		<p> October 17, 2022 - Yesterday, I made my first animation. The project was to mark my new captaincy in my memory. I want to make versions with "A"s instead of a "C" to congragulate my assitant captains on their achievements. I'm very happy with my leadership team, and I'm looking foreward to having more responisbilities at the rink. Coding an animiation was more simple than I thought it would be and despite not having many project ideas, I'm excited to see what I can do with css animaitons. </p>

		<p> October 27, 2022 - All of my projects have been pushed, and my journal enteries have been typed out. Today I want to work on touching up the format of my animation project to make it seem more like it's an extension of my website. I think I've been pretty consistant with my aesthetic. I also want to find a way to make my journal page more interactive. Looking at a giant page of text can be kind of overwhelming, and I want to explore methoods of making it more fun! Today I also want to get my about me page started.</p>

		<p> November 7, 2022 - What is an Event Listener? What is an Event? How do you get it to show up in the console? How do you get "into" and console.log the different "atributes" of an event? An Event Listener waits for a trigger to create a record. Events are the entire libraries of information which are stored to be reviewed in the console. In javascript, you can use "." to specfify what part of the event you want to record. For our specific project, we use the "." to indicate that we want the coordinates of "clientX" and "clientY" </p>

		<p> January 5, 2023 - Happy New Year! I don't really remember where I left off with my journal, so I'll decribe my newest project. I made a random line generator for three of the teams that play our of my rink. My team had a scrimmage with one of the boys teams, and I got to use my project to create lines for the game. It helped to avoid conflict and create some pretty scrambled lines. We wasted no time getting on the ice, and I got to play agaisnt some of my friends who I'm competative with. I scored a lot and had a pretty beautiful hit on one of my friends which made us both laugh.</p>

		<p> January 5, 2023 - Contining: I had a idea for a new project. I've been getting into sports photography recently, and I want to create a new website for my photos and videos. I would want it to be seperate from my current website, so I'll need to sketch how I would want it to look. I've been spending a lot of time in the art department recently, and I have learned to use illustrator and other drawing applications, so hopefully I can create a pretty customized website to display and distribute my photography. I've been really stressed recently due to the amount of work and pressure that comes with school. Hockey as kept me busy as well, so I hope this can serve as a fun project for me.</p>

		<p> February 16, 2023 - I've been working directly in github on a website for my hockey photography. I was asked to take photos for a Fieldston v.s. Riverdale high school game which was a great experience. I had a lot of fun taking pictures of my friends at both schools. Having set up the website before, I was able to share lower quality versions of my photos quickly with players from both schools. I was also able to quickly add a watermark and logo to all of the photos which gave me more control over who had access to what pictures. I also started a featured player profile page with names, numbers, positions, and teams. This has made my website more interactive to the players. I'm still missing a few numbers and photos, so more work needs to be done outside of coding. </p>
