		<p> October 6, 2022 - Today I spend a lot of class changing the colors of my website. I had most of the logistics layed out so I really got to focus on aesthetics. There are a lot of tags and style choices that I wouldn't even think to add, so I found it enjoyable to experiment and find the styles that worked with my aesthetic. I definatly prefer muted colors to the brighter options that are named with more common names. Becasue of this, searching for the right colors was kind of a pain, but once I had everything saved, I really liked the way that my website turned out. :) </p>
